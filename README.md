I used this in teaching my Mentees responsive design, Redux and MERN stack as a whole.

Redux is used to manage state especially username of the logged in user fo the user info will ge accessible in the whole application. Username is visible at the top of every application page, that is managed with Redux. You need to be a signed in user to place comment on this small blog application.

Generall Redux is used heavily in managin user information accross the whole application
